# Simulation-optimization-with-a-sequence-of-approximating-systems
This is the Python code for algorithms in paper Gradient-based Simulation-Optimization Algorithms via a Sequence of Increasingly Accurate Approximations for an Original System.

'FD estimator.py' contains algorithm in Section 3, that uses approximating systems to construct finite difference estimators.

'Multilevel FD estimator.py' contains algorithm in Section 4, that uses approximating systems to construct multilevel finite difference estimators.

'result_and_pictures.py' contains the result for 20 dimensional experiments and the source of pictures in the manuscript.
